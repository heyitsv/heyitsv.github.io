Making / Sources:
Globe: For the globe i used the open source webgl globe - https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe
Data: As it says in the intro, WikiGlobe takes snippets of Wikipedia articles using Wikipedia's API, dowloads them, and displays them in the site.

I, myself made the styling, idea, concept, and overall site.
Alltogether i say i made 40% of the site with my own skills and 60% with other people technologies. 
It was a fun learning experience and turned out to be a GREAT site.
